# ImageEditor.java
A simple image editor that takes .ppm files and performs some edits to the image.

I have always been fascinated by the way that programs like Photoshop and even Word can flip images or make them in black and white. Though some of the more fancier edits require quite a bit of fancy code, I decided that I would explore this field by creating a program that can do some edits to an inputted image file.

Particularly, this program can flip an image horizontally or vertically, convert an image to grayscale, convert it to a negative mode, or convert it to an extreme constrast mode. It can also do multiple conversions to the same image file, so I can make an image grayscale, then flip it, and then make it negative, all before saving it as a new image file.
